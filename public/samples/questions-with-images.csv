example-uuid-math-001,example-uuid-geometry-001,JAMB,2023,medium,"What is the measure of angle ABC in the diagram?",,,https://example.com/images/triangle-abc.png,"Right triangle ABC with angle A marked as 30 degrees and angle C marked as 60 degrees",400,300,30°,60°,90°,120°,,C,Remember that the sum of angles in a triangle equals 180°,"Using the triangle angle sum property: 30° + 60° + angle B = 180°. Therefore, angle B = 180° - 30° - 60° = 90°",https://example.com/triangle-properties

The shaded region is the area between the square and circle",500,500,21.5 cm²,28.5 cm²,35.7 cm²,42.9 cm²,,B,Calculate the area of the square and subtract the area of the circle,"Area of square = 10² = 100 cm². Area of circle = π × 5² ≈ 78.5 cm². Shaded area = 100 - 78.5 = 21.5 cm²",https://example.com/area-calculations
